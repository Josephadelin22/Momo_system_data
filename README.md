##  Project Description  
This project is about building an **enterprise-level fullstack application** to process MoMo SMS transaction data.  

- **Extract**: Get SMS transaction data in XML format  
- **Transform**: Clean, normalize, and categorize transactions  
- **Load**: Store processed data into a relational database (SQLite)  
- **Visualize**: Build a frontend dashboard for analysis  

The backend ETL pipeline is powered by **Python**, while the frontend uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. An optional **FastAPI API** may provide analytics endpoints.  

---

##  High-Level System Architecture  
The system works as follows:  

**MoMo SMS (XML Data)** â†’ **Python ETL Pipeline** â†’ **SQLite Database** â†’ **Processed JSON** â†’ **Frontend Dashboard**  
*(Optional: SQLite Database â†’ FastAPI API â†’ Frontend Dashboard)*

# MoMo SMS Data Processing â€“ Week 2  

## Project Description  
This project is about building an **enterprise-level fullstack application** to process MoMo SMS transaction data.  

In Week 2, our focus was on **Database Design and Implementation**, ensuring the system can efficiently store, query, and analyze mobile money transactions. The core work included:  

- Designing a complete **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.  
- Implementing the **MySQL database schema** with proper constraints and indexes.  
- Creating **JSON schemas** to represent entities and simulate API responses.  
- Producing full **database design documentation**, including rationale, data dictionary, sample queries, and constraints.  
- Updating our **Scrum board** to reflect completed tasks and new sprints.  

---

## Database Design (ERD)  
We created an ERD with the following entities and relationships:  

- **Users** â†’ stores customer information.  
- **Transactions** â†’ stores transaction records linked to users and categories.  
- **Categories** â†’ holds transaction types (Debit, Credit, Airtime, etc.).  
- **System Logs** â†’ records transaction log events for traceability.

## Database Implementation (MySQL)  
We implemented the database schema in MySQL with:  
- **Primary Keys and Foreign Keys** for referential integrity.  
- **CHECK constraints** to prevent invalid data.  
- **Indexes** for faster queries.  
- **Sample test data** (5 records per main table).  

[SQL Script](database/database_setup.sql)  

---

## JSON Data Modeling  
We built JSON schemas for each entity:  
- **User**  
- **Category**  
- **Transaction**  
- **System Log**  
- **Transaction Full** (nested object with user, category, and logs)  

[JSON Schemas](examples/json_schemas.json)   

---

## Documentation  
All detailed documentation is compiled in a single PDF file containing:  
- ERD with rationale and design decisions  
- Data dictionary (tables, attributes, and descriptions)  
- SQL â†” JSON mapping  
- Sample queries with results  
- Security & accuracy rules (constraints)

## Scrum Board  
We continued using Agile practices and updated our Scrum board for Week 2.
